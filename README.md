# Thyroid Cancer Recurrence Prediction ML Model
A project to make an ML model that predicts thyroid cancer recurrence (classification) using Python.
## Project Description üß†
This project aims to develop a model that can reliably predicts cancer recurrence based on patient's data. In this model, we will test various algorithms ranging from decision tree algorithms like Random Forest to ANN-based model using TensorFlow.
